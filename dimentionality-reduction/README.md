# PCA

Large datasets are increasingly common and are often difficult to interpret. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets, increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss. It does so by creating new uncorrelated variables that successively maximize variance.

# [LDA](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_python_lda.html#introduction)

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a dimensionality reduction technique. As the name implies dimensionality reduction techniques reduce the number of dimensions (i.e. variables) in a dataset while retaining as much information as possible. 

PCA is unsupervised but LDA is supervised.
