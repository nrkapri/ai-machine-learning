# Cluserting 

## K-means Clustering 

Pseudocode:

*Step 1: choose number of K clusters

*Step 2: Select at Random k points , the centroids 

*Step 3: Assign each data point to the closest centroid --> that forms K clusters

*Step 4: Compute and place the new centroid of each cluster

*Step 5: Reassign each data point to the new closest centroid .
         if any reassignment took place to to Sttep 4 , otherwise Finish.
